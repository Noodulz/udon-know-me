# udon-know-me
A Python terminal app that lets you scan the ports of a website with www. domains as well as identify a website host's IP address. Note to NOT use this on other's websites please! Just your own or get permission.
# Dependencies
You will need the pyfiglet, socket, and termcolor modules via pip install. This application will likely run better in a  Linux environment using Python 3.<br/>
# How to install and use
Install dependencies by first running `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` assuming you already have pip3 and Python3 installed on your system. Then, cd into `src` and run `python3 udon.py` to start the program. Note that only host names are accepted when retrieving the IP address of a website, so generally, you should enter addresses in the form of `www.website-domain-here.com` with whatever website you're trying to scan (ideally your own or with permissions granted from other sites).
